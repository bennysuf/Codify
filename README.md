# Codify

## What my project is:
    this is a web-based application enabling developers
    to showcase and host their portfolios, projects, social links, 
    and resumes, while providing users with a seamless browsing experience 
    to discover and evaluate developers.

    This application uses React.js for Frontend, Ruby on Rails for Backend, 
    and a PostgreSQL database.

## How to use it:
    As a user you can browse Developers and check out their portfolio.

    If you are Developer you can signup or login. 

    Once signed in your account will be automatically set to private, you can 
    change that in the Edit profile section by clicking 'Public profile On', there 
    you can also edit/add your social links, About me page, username, and a link to 
    your resume. You will also be able to delete your profile along with all your projects
    
       - You will need to have a URL for your resume

    
    You will be able to view all your projects and edit them as well on your Projects
    page. 

    When creating a new project, you will need to add a title, description, Link to 
    your Github or demo, and write in the "website" bar the text you would like to 
    be displayed instead of the URL (e.g. Github). By selecting multiple Developers 
    from the dropdown list you can add them as collaborators to that project.
